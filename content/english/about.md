I have over 6 years' experience in the banking industry and 11 years' experience in business development & customer service. I'm an MBA candidate at UC Davis and a certified Project Management Professional (PMP). Most recently, my focus has been on developing a skillset in cloud architecture and machine learning for analytics. I believe that celebrating a company's traditions creates a competitive advantage, and that my expertise in innovation, business development, and new technologies would make me a valuable asset to your team. <br> <br> Email: acorreia@ucdavis.edu
